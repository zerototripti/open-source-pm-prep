## Execution

1.  **How do you prioritize competing features?**

    *   *Example Answer:* "I use a combination of frameworks, including RICE scoring (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) and value vs. effort analysis.  I also consider strategic alignment with product vision and business goals.  Ultimately, prioritization decisions should be data-driven and informed by user feedback.  I would also involve stakeholders to ensure alignment and manage expectations."

2.  **Tell me about a time you had to ship a product under a tight deadline.**

    *   *Example Answer:* "In my previous role, we had a tight deadline for launching a new feature.  To manage this, I worked with the engineering team to scope the project and identify the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).  We prioritized core functionalities and deferred less critical features to a later release. I maintained clear communication with stakeholders, providing regular updates on progress.  We successfully launched the MVP on time, and then iterated based on user feedback." (Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answer.)
